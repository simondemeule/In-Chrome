# Introduction
In Chrome is a web-based interactive experience that allows a group of users to perform Terry Riley's 1964 musical composition In C. In Chrome was notably awarded the Design and Computation Arts prize at Concordia University's 2019 Design and Computation Arts end of year show.

Terry Riley's composition consists of 53 short musical phrases, that, unlike most music, are not arranged in a definitive order by the composer; this control is surrendered to the performers, who are given approximative guidance regarding the order and ways in which these phrases should be interpreted. Performers should play phrases in order, repeating each an arbitrary number of times. As a whole, the group should strive to remain relatively clustered around a local set of phrases. The piece is free to span any length of time, and to be played by any number and kind of instruments. The expressivity and register used are left entirely to the performers' discretion.

In Chrome allows any person, regardless of their musical competence, to take part in the joy of musical expression through a simple web interface. Multiple participants can collaborate through an intuitive networked computer system.

# How to use it
To run this software, install dependencies with npm from package.json, run server.js using node, and connect through port 8080. It is also necessary to note that the client-side only works with Google Chrome's web audio â€” the name is just a terrible pun.
